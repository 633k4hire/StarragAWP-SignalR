"Customer/Technician" Checkout system

*******************************************************************************************************************************

[two update panel timed server polling]
two conditional panels with shared async external trigger
on panel is hidden but contains an ajax timer
session variable is checked in code behind on _tick
if variable says refresh is required
then panel 2 is bound and updated using the async button call, 
only refreshing  panel 2 when there is a need

or us settimout ajax call to webmethod for near realtime update


use l0xx0r file templates
search / filter bar on left

create new "checkout / outcart" pages for this only

Create confimation number ID

once cart is confirmed and email is sent out to  both logged in TEch and shipping office (michael/tunget/jason)


a public class PendingTransaction{}

is made contaiing the requestor, list of assets, date, customer or custom address, Timesamp, Transaction ID(confirmation number for User), PREFERED SHIPPING METHOD

if is custom address create New Customer() and add to setttting file and save.gloabls();


pending transaction database is created and each transaction is added to it via SQL

Admins will have a special page call /Account/Transactions.apsx (and short cut with badges on main menu)



[Transactions.apsx]

will contain a self updating table of current transactions and te ability to sort, search anf filter transactions based on date, customer, tech, asset id, transaction id

clicking on a pending transaction allows the transactino to be edited and approved

upon approval the pending transaction checks available stock(warns if insuf) adds to checkoutlist session variable and then forwards to Checkout.aspx 
		for final inspection and paperwork / label creation

		
pending transaction is removed from the pending library, and update is sent to tech telling thm a tool is cheked out

all db are updated

signal goes out that there is a change occured to refresh all attached clients
